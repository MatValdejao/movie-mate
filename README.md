# Movie Mate

## Summary

Often times, when discussing movies with friends, we forget many details such as actor names. Other times, we are thinking about watching a movie but want to better undstand what they are about and the reviews about the movie. Movie Mate is movie search application that allows users to input a movie title and get brief information about the plot, cast, awards won, and reviews. The app stores previous searches in local storage. 

## User Story

* SO THAT I can connect with conversations around me
* GIVEN I haven't seen a movie that is being talked about
* WHEN I am trying to make connections with other humans
* THEN I expect a short plot and review returned to me in order to include myself in the conversation
